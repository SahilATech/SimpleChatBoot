# * [Custom Display logic](../examples/IPython%20Kernel/Custom%20Display%20Logic.ipynb)
# * [Running a Secure Public Notebook Server](../examples/Notebook/Running%20the%20Notebook%20Server.ipynb#Securing-the-notebook-server)
# * [How Jupyter works](../examples/Notebook/Multiple%20Languages%2C%20Frontends.ipynb) to run code in different languages.

# You can also get this tutorial and run it on your laptop:
# 
#     git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth
# 
# Install IPython and Jupyter:
# 
# with [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download):
# 
#     conda install ipython jupyter
# 
# with pip:
# 
#     # first, always upgrade pip!
#     pip install --upgrade pip
#     pip install --upgrade ipython jupyter
# 
# Start the notebook in the tutorial directory:
# 
#     cd ipython-in-depth
#     jupyter notebook
